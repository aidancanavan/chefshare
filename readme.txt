HCI Project - High Fidelity Prototype

Mobile Website- chefshare
------------------------

The website works best in the google chrome inspect element mobile view menu,
however it will scale to fit a 50% window but will not work as well.

100% window does not work well, further implementation would detect this and have
a seperate interface for non mobile users.

Best setting for viewing: iphone 6/7/8, X, pixel 2, pixel 2 XL

f12 (inspect element), toggle device toolbar
----------------------
login.html: no login implemented, click "log in" button to be directed to feed.html

feed.html: tabs at top sort each post; like button works; likes save bewteen tabs

explore.html: horizontal tabs show what each section could look like.

profile: setting gear in top right will allow you to log out. (no other implementation)
